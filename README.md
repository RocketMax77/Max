# About Me
A little about me...

Junior in high school with a passion for all things that fly and technology and engineering in general, especially rockets. I run a youtube channel were I go over my builds, currently relating to rocketry (@RocketsAndRobots77). And I plan to post my code from my builds on this platform.
